# DSA_in_JAVA
Practicing my Data Structures and algorithms to brush-up my skillset.

While preparing for interviews for top companies, the main thing comes is to prepare for Data Structures and Algorithms in depth. Hence i have started to work on my DSA skills in order to ace in interviews. 
I will be uploading my work on regular basis starting from recursion, backtracking and till graphs , DP and at last Bit Masking.

The detailed topics are as follows:
> Recursion

> BackTracking

> Array

> LinkedList

> Stack & Queue

> Tree

> Heap, Hashtable, Tries

> Java Collection Frameworks

> Graphs

> Dynamic Programming (DP)

> Bit Masking

Till then stay connected.
Happy Coding :D
